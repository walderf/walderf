### hi!

i'm just a regular guy who didn't pursue a career in technology but has been using it for decades. i'm currently in the process of learning and re-learning everything i can about the technology i've neglected over the past years. i eventually see myself learning python, but that will take some time. 

be sure to check out [walderf/stuff](../stuff/) to see the stuff that's in the stuff repository. it contains stuff like links about linux, computers, security, servers, etc. it also houses some scripts that do stuff. i am also sharing some of my system and application configuration files, or dotfiles, in [walderf/dotfiles](../dotfiles/)
