### hi!

i'm just a regular guy who didn't pursue a career in technology but has been using it for decades. i'm currently in the process of learning and re-learning everything i can about the technology i've neglected over the past several years. i eventually see myself learning python, but that will take some time. 

be sure to check out https://walderf.github.io/things/ to see things such as articles and links, pertaining to security and privacy, which might make you go "woah. holy sheet!" there are also similar things regarding the hardening, general administration, and configuration of *(mainly \*nix-related)* OS things. plus, there is a *(slowly)* growing list which will introduce/re-introduce some nifty and useful CLI tools 'n things. 

most importantly, referring back to "woah. holy sheet!" inducing stuff i mentioned earlier, a few of these links and things regarding **"privacy"**, some of whose content i consider detrimental, can and absolutely \*_will_\* benefit \*__any__\* and \*__every__\* level of computer and internet user. if nothing else, check these things out. if not for yourself, and please [read this article](https://www.wired.com/story/big-data-may-not-know-your-name-but-it-knows-everything-else/) if you're not convinced, then consider all the implications, and dutifully pass the information along to friends, relatives, co-workers, etc. this action is for the greater good of humanity, not only today, but, with significantly more importance, it's future. our future. \*_the_\* future.   *( <-- not a joke or even close to a "stretch" )*  :|    

~~it also houses some scripts that do stuff.~~ i am also sharing some of my system and application configuration files, or dotfiles, in [walderf/dotfiles](https://github.com/walderf/dotfiles)

:)
