### hi!

i'm just a regular guy who didn't pursue a career in technology but has been using it for decades.  i'm currently in the process of learning and re-learning everything i can about the technology i've neglected over the past several years.  i eventually see myself learning python, but that will take some time. 

<br />

## things

feel free to check out https://walderf.github.io/things/, a replacement for [https://github.com/walderf/stuff/oldREADME.md](https://github.com/walderf/stuff/blob/main/oldREADME.md), to see things such as articles and links, pertaining to, but not limited to, computers, the internet, security, and some privacy-rlated things that just might make you go:  _"woah. holy sheet!"_.  

there are also some things regarding the general administration, configuration, and hardening of *(mainly \*nix-related)* OSes.  plus, there is a *(slowly)* growing list of nifty commandline (CLI) things, that either contain their own unique function(s), enhance existing functions, or straight-up replace some more commonly-used tools/utilities. 

<br />

## dotfiles

i am also sharing some of my system and application configuration files, or dotfiles, in [walderf/dotfiles](https://github.com/walderf/dotfiles). 


<br />
<br />

the aforementioned "woah. holy sheet!" inducing **"privacy"** things

----

<br />

allow me to reiterate the importance of this topic. 

<br />

### ***privacy*** online ***is*** pretty much ***non-existent***. 

*(this is, if at the time you're reading this, it's not already completely gone.)*

<br />

the resources, ( [articles](https://walderf.github.io/things/articles/#privacy) and [links](https://walderf.github.io/things/links/#privacy) ), i have assembled contain quite detailed, descriptive information on various, *( \*FREE\* and open-source, of course! )*, methods aimed to protect you online.   


what's better than no-catch, direct links to easy-to-follow, straight-forward, and resources that range from "quick-and-easy-to-implement" all the way to "hardcore AF"??   the best part is, many of the "services" mentioned are active all the time, every time, and require, once up-and-running, a rarely-to-never level of interaction by the end-user.

<br />
<br />


##### these things can and absolutely \*_will_\* benefit \*__any__\* and \*__every__\* level of internet-connected computer user.

<br />


not convinced?  please [read this article](https://www.wired.com/story/big-data-may-not-know-your-name-but-it-knows-everything-else/).  as you're reading, consider all of the implications.  then, even if you, yourself, feel like you're already good 'n protected.  or, perhaps, you just flat out refuse to direct your attention to such matters,  read the title of [this article](https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy/features/your-digital-footprint-its-bigger-than-you-realize/) and surmise to \*_act dutifully_\*.  your assigned duty is to, as casually or as fear-based-paranoia-ridden-franticly as you deem fit, ***\*please\**** pass this information along!  to friends!  relatives!  co-workers!  strangers??  aliens.


this simple action, if you will, is for the greater good of humanity.  a humanity present not only *today*, but, and with significantly more importance, tomorrow.  humanity's future.  our future.  \*_the_\* future.   *( <-- not a joke or even close to a "truth-stretch" :| )*  :)
