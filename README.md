### hi!

i'm just a regular guy who didn't pursue a career in technology but has been using it for decades.  i'm currently in the process of learning and re-learning everything i can about the technology i've neglected over the past several years.  i eventually see myself learning python, but that will take some time. 

be sure to check out https://walderf.github.io/things/ to see things such as articles and links pertaining to things like security and privacy, some of which might just make you go "woah. holy sheet!".  there are also some of these things regarding general administration, configuration, and hardening of *(mainly \*nix-related)* OS things.  plus, there is a *(slowly)* growing list of things, which will serve to potentially introduce, but if not, perhaps re-introduce some nifty commandline (CLI) tools, that either introduce their own unique function(s), enhance existing functions, or, in some cases, straight-up replace, some commonly-used commands and/or built-in utilities. 

most importantly, referring back to "woah. holy sheet!" inducing stuff i mentioned earlier, a few of these links and things surround the topic of **"privacy"**. having content i consider detrimental, these thins can and absolutely \*_will_\* benefit \*__any__\* and \*__every__\* level of internet-connected computer user. 

seriously, if nothing else, check these things out.  not convinced?  please [read this article](https://www.wired.com/story/big-data-may-not-know-your-name-but-it-knows-everything-else/), then consider all of the implications, and then, even if you, yourself, feel like you're already good 'n protected, or, perhaps you might just flat out refuse to navigate through the linked resources, act dutifully.  this means, as casually, or, as fear-based-paranoia-ridden-frantic, as you deem fit, **please** pass this information along to friends. relatives. co-workers. strangers?  

this simple action, if you will, is for the greater good of humanity.  a humanity present not only *today*, but, and with significantly more importance, humanity's future.  our future.  \*_the_\* future.   *( <-- not a joke or even close to a "truth-stretch" :| )*  :)    


oh!  ~~it also houses some scripts that do stuff.~~ i am also sharing some of my system and application configuration files, or dotfiles, in [walderf/dotfiles](https://github.com/walderf/dotfiles). 

:)
